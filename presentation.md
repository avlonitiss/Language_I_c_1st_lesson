# Introduction to C Programming: Simple Exercises with `printf`

## Slide 1: Introduction to C Programming
**Title**: Introduction to C Programming  
**Subtitle**: First Steps: Using `printf`  
**Content**:
- Welcome to the first lesson in C programming.
- Overview: Understanding how to use the `printf` function.
- Exercises will focus on printing text and variables to the console.

---

## Slide 2: Exercise 1 – Print a Simple Message
**Title**: Exercise 1: Print a Simple Message  
**Subtitle**: Understanding the Basics  
**Content**:
1. Use `printf` to display a simple message: `"Welcome to C programming!"`
2. Focus on syntax: `printf("message");`
3. Ensure proper use of the semicolon and double quotes.

**Code Example**:
```c
printf("Welcome to C programming!\n");

Slide 3: Exercise 2 – Print a Variable Value

Title: Exercise 2: Print a Variable Value
Subtitle: Displaying Integer Variables
Content:

	1.	Declare an integer variable: int num = 10;
	2.	Use printf to display the variable’s value: printf("The number is: %d", num);
	3.	Focus on using format specifiers like %d for integers.

Code Example:

int num = 10;
printf("The number is: %d\n", num);

Slide 4: Exercise 3 – Print Multiple Variables

Title: Exercise 3: Print Multiple Variables
Subtitle: Using Multiple Format Specifiers
Content:

	1.	Declare two integer variables: int a = 5; int b = 15;
	2.	Use printf to print both values: printf("The values are: %d and %d", a, b);
	3.	Combine text and multiple format specifiers in a single statement.

Code Example:

int a = 5;
int b = 15;
printf("The values are: %d and %d\n", a, b);

Slide 5: Exercise 4 – Print Floating Point Numbers

Title: Exercise 4: Print Floating Point Numbers
Subtitle: Introducing Floating Point Format Specifiers
Content:

	1.	Declare a floating-point variable: float pi = 3.1415;
	2.	Use printf with %f to print the value: printf("The value of pi is: %f", pi);
	3.	Explore precision by limiting decimal places: printf("Pi rounded to two decimals: %.2f", pi);

Code Example:

float pi = 3.1415;
printf("The value of pi is: %f\n", pi);
printf("Pi rounded to two decimals: %.2f\n", pi);

Slide 6: Exercise 5 – Print Special Characters

Title: Exercise 5: Print Special Characters
Subtitle: Escaping Special Characters
Content:

	1.	Print special characters like newlines and quotation marks.
	2.	Example: printf("This is a new line\nAnd this is in quotes: \"C programming\"\n");
	3.	Use escape sequences like \n for a new line and \" for quotes.

Code Example:

printf("This is a new line\n");
printf("And this is in quotes: \"C programming\"\n");

Slide 7: Conclusion – What’s Next?

Title: What’s Next?
Subtitle: Building on the Basics
Content:

	•	Review: Printing text, integers, floating-point numbers, and special characters using printf.
	•	Preview of the next lesson: Using scanf to accept user input.
